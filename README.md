# BaseSpace-Ruby

BaseSpace-Ruby is an unofficial Ruby based Software Development Kit to be used in the development of Apps and scripts for working with Illumina's BaseSpace cloud-computing solution for next-gen sequencing data analysis.

The primary purpose of the SDK is to provide an easy-to-use Ruby environment enabling developers to authenticate a user, retrieve data, and upload data/results from their own analysis to BaseSpace.

An official BaseSpace Ruby SDK gem is available but I hope to improve upon it and eventually create a gem from this repository.

Please feel free to fork and send pull requests if you would like to contribute to this repo.
